## Abstract & Method

### Overview
- Analyzed play-by-play football data
- Focused on formation, down, distance, and play type
- Used clustering and visualization to uncover tendencies
  
### Questions
- How often does a team run or pass based on situation?
- How often is a formation Run or Passed out of?

### Team Play Calling by Down
- Highlights variation in play calling across teams
- Run-heavy vs pass-heavy tendencies by down

## Summary: Pass Rate by Down and Distance

### Heatmap Summary
- Higher % pass on 2nd/3rd & long
- Lower % pass on early downs or short yardage

## First Down Pass Rates by Distance

### Trends on 1st Down
- Teams tend to run more on short yardage
- CPA has balanced look; CIT very pass-heavy

## Second Down Pass Rates by Distance

::: columns

::: column
### Trends on 2nd Down
- More aggressive play calling emerges
- CIT passes more as distance increases

## Third Down Pass Rates by Distance

::: columns
::: column

::: column
### Trends on 3rd Down
- Passing becomes dominant on 3rd & long
- Run attempts mostly vanish except for surprise plays

## Formation vs Play Type Tendencies

::: columns
::: column
![KMeans](images/Form_Kmeans.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### K-Means Clustering
- Clusters formations by % pass, avg down, and distance
- Labels: Run-Only, Run-Heavy, Balanced, Pass-Heavy
:::

## Run vs Pass Percentages by Formation

::: columns
::: column

::: column
### Dumbbell Chart
- Spread between run/pass shown per formation
- Flags most extreme & balanced formations

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways
- Strong tendencies exist by team, down, and formation
- Situational awareness is critical (distance + down)
- Formations strongly indicate play type in many cases
