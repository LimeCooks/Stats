## Title Slide

**Project:** Football Scouting Report  
**Author:** Liam Cook  
**Date:** April 2025

## Abstract & Method

### Overview
- Analyzed play-by-play football data
- Focused on formation, down, distance, and play type
- Used clustering and visualization to uncover tendencies

---

## Formation Frequency by Field Zone

::: columns
::: column
![Formation by Zone](images/Forms_by_team.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Visual Summary
- Shows top 2 formations by team in each field zone
- Color intensity = play volume
:::
:::

---

## Team-Level Run vs Pass Tendencies by Down

::: columns
::: column
![Team Tendencies](images/Team_Tendencies_by_Down.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Team Play Calling by Down
- Highlights variation in play calling across teams
- Run-heavy vs pass-heavy tendencies by down
:::
:::

---

## Play Type by Distance to Go and Down

::: columns
::: column
![Down-Distance](images/Dist_Down_Play_Type.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Scatter View
- Each dot = one play by down/distance/team
- Useful for spotting situational play call patterns
:::
:::

---

## Summary: Pass Rate by Down and Distance

::: columns
::: column
![Heatmap](images/Summary_heatmap.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Heatmap Summary
- Higher % pass on 2nd/3rd & long
- Lower % pass on early downs or short yardage
:::
:::

---

## First Down Pass Rates by Distance

::: columns
::: column
![First Down](images/First_down.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Trends on 1st Down
- Teams tend to run more on short yardage
- CPA has balanced look; CIT very pass-heavy
:::
:::

---

## Second Down Pass Rates by Distance

::: columns
::: column
![Second Down](images/Second_down.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Trends on 2nd Down
- More aggressive play calling emerges
- CIT passes more as distance increases
:::
:::

---

## Third Down Pass Rates by Distance

::: columns
::: column
![Third Down](images/Third_down.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Trends on 3rd Down
- Passing becomes dominant on 3rd & long
- Run attempts mostly vanish except for surprise plays
:::
:::

---

## Formation vs Play Type Tendencies

::: columns
::: column
![KMeans](images/Form_Kmeans.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### K-Means Clustering
- Clusters formations by % pass, avg down, and distance
- Labels: Run-Only, Run-Heavy, Balanced, Pass-Heavy
:::
:::

---

## Run vs Pass Ratio by Formation

::: columns
::: column
![Run Pass Ratio](images/Run_Pass_Formation.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Horizontal Stacked Bar
- Formations sorted by run-dominant to pass-heavy
- Color shows play type usage
:::
:::

---

## Run vs Pass Percentages by Formation

::: columns
::: column
![Dumbbell](images/Run_Pass_Dumbbell.png){width=100%}
:::

::: column
### Dumbbell Chart
- Spread between run/pass shown per formation
- Flags most extreme & balanced formations
:::

## Conclusion

### Key Takeaways
- Strong tendencies exist by team, down, and formation
- Situational awareness is critical (distance + down)
- Formations strongly indicate play type in many cases
