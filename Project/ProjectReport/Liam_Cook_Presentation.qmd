## Abstract & Research Questions

This project investigates offensive play-calling tendencies in Nova Scotia high school football. I manually tagged five games, analyzing each play based on situation and play type.

I aimed to answer two key questions:
1. How often does a team run or pass based on down and distance?
2. Which formations are strongly predictive of run vs. pass?

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Manually tagged game film from 2024–2025 season  
- **Categorical variables**:  
  <span style="font-size:0.8em;">`Offense_Team`, `Play_Type`, `Offense_Formation`, `Field_Zone`</span>  
- **Quantitative variables**:  
  <span style="font-size:0.8em;">`Start_Yardline`, `Down`, `Distance`</span>

## Conclusion & Thank you!!!

### Key Takeaways
- Strong tendencies exist by team, down, and formation
- Situational awareness is critical (distance + down)
- Formations strongly indicate play type in many cases
  
## Thank You
Thanks for watching!  
I’m happy to answer any follow-up questions.
